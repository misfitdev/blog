# No Robo Blog

I've been using ChatGPT to improve and speed up a bit of my work lately.  The
results are often Good Enough and that's usually all you need.  I've written
documentation, played games with my kid, planned activities, done
preliminary research and written some working code.  All great things and all
perfectly satisfactory.

In the last week I've been playing with the new ChatGPT plugins.  Some of them
are great.  Some of them are really fun.  And then there's the Quick Creator
blogging plugin.  On the surface, it looks great.  It creates great _loooking_
blog posts.  The formatting and layout are fantastic.  I love that it will find
images that look like they belong in the doc.

But then something happens when you actually read the post.  It's... boring.
The content feels empty and there's A LOT of repetition.  Repetition is a
great way to learn something but it doesn't make for meaningful or compelling
arguments.  It's almost like the LLM gets just a little bit drunk and can't
seem to find other words.

So while I'll absolutely continue to use ChatGPT and others as references and
to speed up what I'm doing, I won't let it write posts for me.


_For now..._

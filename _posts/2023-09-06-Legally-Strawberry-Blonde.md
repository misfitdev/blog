Sometimes inspiration comes in the most unlikely of places.  Like when someone said this in a Slack somewhere:

Apparently the World's Dumbest Carrot put his hair color down as "strawberry blonde" when he was booked for his election fraud case in Georgia.  If there's ever good use of ChatGPT, this is one.


# Act 1

## Introduction

- Meet Donald Trump, former president and current defendant in several high-profile legal cases. He's convinced that the only person who can save him is himself.

## Inciting Incident

- His advisors, including Rudy Giuliani, tell him that to represent himself, he'll need an actual law degree.

## The Decision

- Trump decides he'll go to law school. He's "like, really smart" after all.

## Getting Into Law School

- Trump secures his admission to a prestigious law school by promising to fund a new "Trump Wing" for the campus. The administration can't resist the offer.

---

# Act 2

## First Day of School

- Trump descends on the campus in a Trump-branded helicopter. His classmates and professors are puzzled and not impressed. Only Rudy, now a law professor, supports him.

## Mock Trial

- Trump manages to pass a mock trial using his signature tactics: deflection, false claims, and Twitter rants. The class is utterly bewildered but he takes it as a victory.

## The Trump Team

- Trump decides he's ready to represent himself in the upcoming trial. He recruits Rudy to help, who's charmed by Trump's unorthodox approach.

---

# Act 3

## Preparation

- Trump and Rudy prepare for the case, brainstorming catchy slogans and watching cable news for "research."

## The Trial

- In court, Trump's antics reach new heights: he wears a MAGA hat as "evidence," tries to introduce his tweets as legal documents, and shouts "Fake news!" when the prosecution presents facts.

## Climax

- Trump delivers a bewildering closing statement, combining his most famous and ridiculous quotes. He fully expects to win.

---

# Act 4

## The Verdict

- Trump is found guilty on all counts. He's stunned that his antics didn't sway the court.

## Reneging on the Deal

- The law school comes forward, looking to collect on Trump's promise to fund the new "Trump Wing." Trump refuses to pay, leading the school to immediately file a lawsuit against him.

## Aftermath

- As Trump faces yet another legal issue with the law school, he still believes he's done an incredible job. In his eyes, everyone else is just too biased to see his "genius."
